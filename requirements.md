# Expense Tracking Web App - Requirements & Specifications

## 1. Project Overview

A web application for personal financial tracking that allows users to monitor expenses, incomes, and investments through manual entry and document processing (receipts, payslips).

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Expense Management
- **Manual Entry**: Users can manually input expense amounts, categories, and descriptions
- **Receipt Processing**: 
  - Upload receipt photos for automatic OCR processing
  - Extract amount, merchant, date, and individual line items
  - Intelligent item classification for groceries (vegetables, meat, dairy, etc.)
  - General expense categorization (meals, gas, utilities, etc.)
- **Human Verification**: Two-step validation process for all processed documents
- **Confidence Thresholding**: Request photo re-upload if OCR confidence is below threshold
- **Document Storage**: Permanent storage of all uploaded receipts and documents

### 2.2 Income Management
- **Manual Entry**: Direct input of income amounts and sources
- **Payslip Processing**: 
  - Upload payslip documents
  - OCR extraction of gross pay, deductions, net pay
  - Human verification of extracted values
  - Document storage for future reference

### 2.3 Investment Tracking
- **Manual Entry**: Record investment amounts, types, and performance
- **Portfolio Overview**: Basic investment summary and tracking

### 2.4 Data Analysis & Reporting
- **Expense Clustering**: Automatic grouping of similar expenses
- **Category Analysis**: Spending breakdown by category and subcategory
- **Trend Analysis**: Monthly/yearly spending patterns
- **Income vs Expense**: Financial health overview

## 3. Technical Specifications

### 3.1 Architecture
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Python FastAPI or Node.js Express
- **Database**: SQLite (development) → PostgreSQL (production)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem storage for documents
- **OCR Service**: Tesseract OCR or PaddleOCR for local text extraction
- **ML Classification**: Local lightweight models (scikit-learn) or rule-based classification
- **Task Queue**: Background processing for OCR and classification jobs

*For detailed system architecture, component interactions, API specifications, and database schema, see [architecture.md](./architecture.md)*

### 3.2 Core Components
- Authentication & User Management
- Document Upload & Processing Pipeline
- OCR Integration & Text Extraction
- Classification Engine (expenses/income categorization)
- Data Validation & Human Review Interface
- Reporting & Analytics Dashboard
- Document Archive & Retrieval System

### 3.3 Data Models

#### User
- id, email, password_hash, created_at, updated_at

#### Expense
- id, user_id, amount, category, subcategory, description, date, merchant, receipt_id, verified, created_at

#### Income  
- id, user_id, amount, source, type, date, payslip_id, verified, created_at

#### Document
- id, user_id, type (receipt/payslip), file_path, original_filename, ocr_confidence, processed_at

#### ExpenseItem (for itemized receipts)
- id, expense_id, item_name, quantity, unit_price, category, subcategory

### 3.4 Processing Workflow

#### Receipt Processing
1. User uploads receipt photo
2. OCR extracts text and identifies key fields
3. ML model classifies expense type and line items
4. Confidence score calculated for extracted data
5. If confidence < threshold → request re-upload
6. If confidence ≥ threshold → present for human verification
7. User reviews and confirms/corrects extracted data
8. Data saved to database, document archived

#### Payslip Processing
1. User uploads payslip document
2. OCR extracts income data (gross, net, deductions)
3. Present extracted data for verification
4. User confirms/corrects values
5. Income record created, document archived

## 4. User Interface Specifications

### 4.1 Core Pages
- **Dashboard**: Financial overview, recent transactions, quick actions
- **Expenses**: List view, add manual entry, upload receipt
- **Income**: List view, add manual entry, upload payslip
- **Investments**: Portfolio overview, manual entry
- **Analytics**: Charts and reports, spending categorization
- **Documents**: Archive of all uploaded receipts and payslips
- **Verification Queue**: Pending documents requiring human review

### 4.2 Key Features
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Drag-and-drop file upload
- Real-time OCR processing feedback
- Interactive verification interface
- Exportable reports (CSV, PDF)
- Search and filter functionality

## 5. Security & Privacy Requirements

- User authentication and session management
- Encrypted file storage
- Data privacy compliance (GDPR considerations)
- Secure API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization

## 6. Performance Requirements

- OCR processing: < 10 seconds per document
- File upload: Support up to 10MB images
- Response time: < 2 seconds for most operations
- Support for common image formats (JPG, PNG, PDF)

## 7. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
